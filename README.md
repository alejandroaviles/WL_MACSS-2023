This course is designed to provide a practical learning experience through project-based activities. Regrettably, due to time constraints, we won't be able to delve into the weak galaxy lensing theory extensively. However, detailed notes on the topic can be found in this repository.

The workshop will be divided into three sessions, each lasting 1.5 hours. In each session, we will begin with a brief introduction lasting 10-20 minutes, after which we will dive straight into project work.

## 1. Construct an estimator for the convergence (spin-0) field.

## 2. Construct an estimator for the shear (spin-2) field


## 3. Weak Lensing shear Correlation Function with TreeCorr [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/alejandroaviles/WL_MACSS-2023/blob/main/Project3_xipm_from_simulations.ipynb) 

#### We will work out one simulation. You do the same for 10 simulations: 

1. Choose either cosmologies A or B and run the notebook for *gamma_{A,B}.{0-9}.fits*. 
2. Take the average of the 10 realizations and the standard deviations. 
3. Plot the average with error bars
4. *Bonus:* Do the same for the simulations of the convergence *kappa_{A,B}.{0-9}.fits*
